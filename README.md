# Sunspots

Simple LSTM for 1 step predictions using LSTM on time series data.

I used the sunspot dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/monthly-sunspots.csv  
Some data processing functions are taken from:

## Language and framework
The code i written in Python 3 using PyTorch frameork
